# Paper Assets

# Images
Fore every paper, you should provide two images: a thumbnail and a teaser. The thumbnail is MANDATORY. If you don't provide a teaser your paper won't show up on the front page, but that can be OK for some situations.  

The image should be named YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME.png for the thumbnail and YYYY_CONFSHORTNAME_PAPERSHORTNAME_teaser.png for the larger teaser figure.

The aspect ratio for both should be 2:1. The teaser should be roughly 1200x600 and be in the neighborhood of 200-300 KB. The thumbnail should be roughly 400x200 with a file size of roughly 50-70 KB.

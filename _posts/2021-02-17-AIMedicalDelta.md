The possibilities to access the molecular data of cells and tissues are increasing, but this also creates new challenges. How can one find the information needed for research when there is such an enormous amount of data, for example? The scientific program Medical Delta AI for Computational Life Sciences uses AI techniques to unlock biomedical data, discover new candidate drugs, detect special cell abnormalities or connections, and find useful information for research. Leading scientists in the fields of bioinformatics, drug development, AI and computer science collaborate with pharmaceutical companies and with clinicians on the research projects within the program. In addition to the development and application of Computational Life Sciences with AI techniques in general, the program focuses on two lines of research: antibiotic resistance for tuberculosis and targeted medication for brain disorders.

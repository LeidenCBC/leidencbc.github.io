On behalf of the LCBC, Dr. Erik van den Akker will be a partner in a recently [Health~Holland](https://www.health-holland.com/news/2018/07/topsector-lsh-en-sgf-onderzoek-afweer-in-balans) funded project ["DC4Balance"](https://www.health-holland.com/public/news/2018/07/180724-immunologie-call-samenvattingen-onderzoeken.pdf).

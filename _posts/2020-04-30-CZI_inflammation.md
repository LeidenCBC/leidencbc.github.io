Ahmed Mahfouz, together with Prof. dr. Maria Yazdanbakhsh (Dept. of Parasitology) and dr. Mostapha Mbow (Cheikh Anta Diop University, Senegal), has received a grant from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) within their call for 'Single-cell Analysis of Inflammation'. In the next two years, the team will characterize the impact of urbanization on the immune system of rural and urban Africans. Researchers will simultaneously develop large datasets and computational and visualization tools to contribute to the ongoing global Human Cell Atlas effort.

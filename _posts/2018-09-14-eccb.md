LCBC was strongly present at [ECCB2018](http://eccb18.org/). Marcel, Ahmed, Arlin, and Tamim represented LCBC at [ECCB2018](http://eccb18.org/), taking place in Athens, Sep 8 to 12 this year. Arlin presented a poster on her work on identifying gene expression patterns correlated to Parkinson's disease progression (unpublished work) and Tamim presented his method for automatic identification of cell types in mass cytometry single cell data ([preprint](https://www.lcbc.nl/publications/2018_cytof_classification/)).

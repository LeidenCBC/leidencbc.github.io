Our paper on Duchenne muscular dystrophy is published in Scientific Reports. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the expression  patterns of dystrophin isoforms across human brain development uisng data from the Allen Brain Atlas, the Roadmap Epigenomics Consortium, and the FANTOM5 project. The results provide new insights into the cognitive phenotype associated with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  

There is a press-release from LUMC highlighting the paper and you can read the paper [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-12981-5).

Nathalie Doorenweerd presented this work at the  International Congress of the World Muscle Society. Nathalie's poster won the Best Poster Award.

Our collaborators from the [Immunohematology and Blood Transfusion](https://www.lumc.nl/org/ihb/) department at LUMC
published their study showing that memory CD4+ T cells are generated in the human fetal intestine in [Nature Immunology](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41590-018-0294-9).
The extensive study integrates data from several sources, such as Suspension Mass Cytometry, Imaging Mass Cytometry, RNA sequencing and TCR sequencing to paint a wholistic picture of CD4+ T cells in the prenatal immune system.
Particularly, the study identifies T cells with wide-ranging degrees of maturity. “The great thing is that whichever way we looked at them, all the results pointed in the same direction: the T cells are already fairly mature. They looked like mature cells and behaved that way too,” explains Van Unen.

LCBC was involved in the study working on data integration (Tamim) and significant parts of the data analysis were carried out with the [Cytosplore](\projects\cytosplore) software, developed by Thomas.

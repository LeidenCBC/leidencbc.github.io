# Adding a News Posting

## File Names

Each news posting must have a file name following this pattern:

```
YYYY_MM_DD_TITLE.md
```

The date is use for publishing and sorting the entry. You can for example add a news item with a future date and it will be
published automatically at that date.

## Keys and Content

Each entry must have the following structure:

```
---
layout: post
title: title
date: 2017-05-01 12:00:00
categories: one of { event | award | press | *tbd* }
---
Free content.
```

The content is formatted using [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

TODO: example, inline images, videos, etc...

We are excited to announce that our paper [Visual Analysis of Mass Cytometry Data by Hierarchical Stochastic Neighbor Embedding Reveals Rare Cell Types](/publications/2017_hsne_nature_communications/), previously available on [BiorXiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/169888) has been published in [Nature Communications](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-01689-9). The paper describes the application of HSNE, a hierarchical SNE-based technique that allows the exploration of datasets too large for other SNE-based techniques (such as t-SNE) through a hierarchical representation, to single cell mass cytometry data. See the movie below for an exemplary exploration of a dataset consisting of 5 Million cells.

Along with the paper we released a major update for our single cell analysis software [Cytosplore](https://www.cytosplore.org) now featuring HSNE alongside A-tSNE and SPADE for single cell analysis. The software is available for free to download at [https://www.cytosplore.org](https://www.cytosplore.org)

The paper is the result of a strong collaboration between multiple groups at LUMC and TU Delft. Press releases from [LUMC](https://www.lumc.nl/over-het-lumc/nieuws/2017/november/interactieve-technologie-zeldzame-celtypen/?setlanguage=English&setcountry=en) and [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2017/tu-delft/new-interactive-technology-makes-rare-cell-types-visible/) are available.

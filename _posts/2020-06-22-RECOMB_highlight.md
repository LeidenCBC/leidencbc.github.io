The single cell classification benchmark  paper by Tamim and Lieke ([Abdelaal*, Michielsen*, et al. Genome biology 2019](/publications/2019_benchmark_genomebiol/)) was selected for a Highlight Talk at [RECOMB](https://www.recomb2020.org/) (INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RESEARCH IN COMPUTATIONAL MOLECULAR BIOLOGY). The conference was set to take place in Padova in April but due to COVID-19, it took place virtually on June 22-25, 2020. Ahmed gave the talk using Zoom to an audience of more than 700 attendees!

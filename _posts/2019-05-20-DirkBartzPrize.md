The [work](/publications/2019_dirk_bartz_prize/) was submitted in collaboration with Nicola Pezzotti, Elmar Eisemann, and Anna Vilanova from [TU Delft](https://graphics.tudelft.nl) and Vincent van Unen, Na Li, Frits Koning, and Boudewijn Lelieveldt from [LUMC](https://www.lumc.nl)

In 2010 the Eurographics Medical Prize was renamed to the Dirk Bartz Prize for Visual Computing in Medicine to honor Dirk Bartz who passed away far too early in March the same year. Dirk was a highly recognized and enthusiastic scientist, teacher and promoter of Visual Computing in Medicine, an active member of the Eurographics Association, and Chair of the EG Medical Prizes 2007 and 2009.

After a short presentation of the project, Thomas was awarded with the 1st prize by this years chairs Steffen Oeltze-Jafra (middle) and Stefan Bruckner (left).

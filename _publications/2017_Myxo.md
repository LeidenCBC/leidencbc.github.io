abstract: "Chemosensory systems (CSS) are among the most complex organizations
of proteins functioning cooperatively to regulate bacterial motility and other
cellular activities. These systems have been studied extensively in bacteria, and usually,
they are present as a single system. Eight CSS, the highest number in bacteria,
have been reported in Myxococcus xanthus DK1622 and are involved in coordinating
diverse functions. Here, we have explored and compared the CSS in all available genomes
of order Myxococcales. Myxococcales members contain 97 to 476 twocomponent
system (TCS) proteins, which assist the bacteria in surviving and adapting
to varying environmental conditions. The number of myxobacterial CSS ranges
between 1 and 12, with the largest number in family Cystobacteraceae and the smallest
in Nannocystaceae. CheA protein was used as a phylogenetic marker to infer evolutionary
relatedness between different CSS, and six novel CSS (“extra CSS” [ECSS]) were thus
identified in the myxobacteria besides the previously reported Che1 to Che8 systems
from M. xanthus. Che1 to Che8 systems are monophyletic to deltaproteobacteria,
whereas the newly identified ECSS form separate clades with different bacterial classes.
The comparative modular organization was concordant with the phylogeny. Four clusters
lacking CheA proteins were also identified via CheB-based phylogenetic analysis and
were categorized as accessory CSS (ACSS). In Archangium, an orphan CSS was identified,
in which both CheA and CheB were absent. The novel, accessory, and orphan multimodular
CSS identified here suggest the emergence of myxobacterial CSS and could assist
in further characterizing their roles."

Recent developments in data acquisition, especially for bio-medical applications, lead to ever increasing size and complexity of datasets.
To find the unknown in such data, exploration beyond computational analytics is necessary.
Our goal is to combine computational approaches with interactive visualization to allow the efficient exploration of data and provide the tools for sound analytical reasoning on its contents driven by visual inspection.
A large amount of biological data is so called high-dimensional data, i.e., a single data-point is described by a large number of values, ranging from a handful of dimensions in flow and tensor data to tens of proteins in in Proteomics data to thousands of genes in Genomics data.
The analysis of such high-dimensional data is the main focus of our visualization and visual analytics research, where we work on specialized tools for dimensionality reduction in combination with clustering and interactive and integrated approaches.

The most recent breakthrough in genomics is the ability to determine the molecular profiles of single cells in a high throughput fashion. Data from hundred thousands, even millions of cells, is becoming available, measuring full genomes, transcriptomes and proteomes of every single cell. These advances are generating a wealth of data, allowing researchers to capture the hidden heterogeneity in each sample. For example, which cells do appear in blood, and how does their transcriptional profile look like. Or, which cells make up the hippocampus of the brain, and what tasks do they perform. In cancer, this offers possibilities to capture the heterogeneity of different cell clones and how they evolve over the course of disease to escape targeted therapies. Clearly, the sheer amount of data stresses the limits of current analysis techniques. But, we also observe stochastic behavior between similar cells. For example, that in one cell there are a few RNA molecules of a specific gene, whereas in a similar other cell there are none. This call for new analysis methodologies that can deal with these stochasticity. In LCBC, we develop new algorithms to analyze single cell data to answer biological questions.

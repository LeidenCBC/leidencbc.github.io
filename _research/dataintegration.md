Processes within the living cell, tissue and body are regulated on various molecular levels of which many can be interrogated in detail using a specific so-called 'omics' platform. Perhaps the most renowned class of 'omics' platforms are the 'genomics' approaches in which variations in the DNA or RNA sequence can be measured at a nucleotide resolution using next generation sequencing technology. Other 'omics' approaches include for instance 'epigenomics', - platforms that employ next generation sequencing technology to measure genome-wide epigenetic modifications -, or 'metabolomics', - platforms employing Nuclear Magnetic Resonance or Mass Spectrometry to quantitate metabolite levels -. Each of these omics platforms captures an unique aspect of the molecular processes that may play a role in the investigated traits or diseases and by finding smart ways of jointly analysing these data sources, we might gain a more comprehensive view on the determinants of health and disease.

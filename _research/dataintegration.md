Processes within the living cell, tissue and body are regulated on various molecular levels of which many can be interrogated in detail using a specific so-called 'omics' platform. Each of these omics platforms captures an unique aspect of the molecular processes that may play a role in traits or diseases. By developing smart ways of jointly analysing these data sources, we might gain a more comprehensive view on the determinants of health and disease.

short-text: "Cytosplore is an interactive visual analysis system for understanding how the immune system works. The goal of the analysis framework is to provide a clear picture of the immune systems cellular composition and the cells’ corresponding properties and functionality. Cytosplore incorporates state-of-the art clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques such as HSNE, allowing the exploration of millions of cells without the need for downsampling."

long-text: "Cytosplore is an interactive visual analysis system for understanding how the immune system works. The goal of the analysis framework is to provide a clear picture of the immune systems cellular composition and the cells’ corresponding properties and functionality. Cytosplore is targeted at the analysis of mass cytometry (CyTOF) data. Mass cytometry is a novel technique to determine the properties of single-cells with unprecedented detail. This amount of detail allows for much finer differentiation but also comes at the cost of more complex analysis. Cytosplore incorporates state-of-the art clustering and dimensionality reduction techniques. The inclusion of HSNE allows the exploration of millions of cells without the need for downsampling. Furthermore Cytosplore provides Approximated-tSNE (up to 100x faster than standard t-SNE without loss in precision) and a custom implementation of the SPADE clustering algorithm. Cytosplore implements progressive visual analytics and visualization techniques to provide a highly engaging user experience through direct feedback and linked views"

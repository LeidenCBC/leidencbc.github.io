# Add a short description for the listing page here. keep it short to dont break the layout onm /projects
short-text: "The Cytosplore project combines basic methodological research on visual analysis of high-dimensional data with highly relevant applied research in single-cell analysis.
At the core of the project is the Cytosplore software, a publicly available, interactive and robust software for single-cell analysis."

# longer description of the project used on top of the project page. use this for an extended abstract
long-text: "The Cytosplore project forms a research framework on interactive visual analysis of high-dimensional data. The core is the Cytosplore software. Besides its application to single-cell analysis the Cytosplore software is a robust and extensible visual analysis framework for high-dimensional data. This project combines basic methodological research with highly relevant applied research in single-cell analysis."

If you are a student looking for a possible internship or thesis topic, we have several open projects and possibilities. Please see the section on the right for specific projects, but other possibilities can always be discussed in person.
The projects can range from fundamental to very applied and can be focused on gathering practical experience or research.
Projects can be at LUMC or in collaboration with the [Computer Graphics and Visualization](https://graphics.tudelft.nl){:target="_blank_"} group at TU Delft.
